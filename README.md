Learning and experimenting javascript features and libraries

## Active Usages

Below libraries are the ones we use currently for our development on javascript
side.

- [matter.js](matter-js/README.md): The library we use when we require a
  physical body-like dom elements or visuals on a web page
- [vite.js](vite-js/README.md): We use `Vite.js` with its `Hot Module
  Replacement` feature to make our development process easier

## Researches

These researches were started, but as a result we decided not to use them for
now.

- [storybook](storybook/README.md): We considered `Storybook` for automated UI
  component testing
