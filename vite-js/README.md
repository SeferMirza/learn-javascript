# Vite.js

Vite.js speeds up the development process with its
[Hot Module Replacement](hot-module-replacement) feature. Because of this
feature, we used to research, we learned, we use it.

## Hot Module Replacement

Hot Module Replacement, as the name suggests, watches the source content during
development and updates the built content in case of a change.This eliminates
the need to stop and restart the project every time a change is required.

## How to Use?

There are many different ways to use it. For example, we use `Nuxt` on websites
where we present our documents. `Nuxt` is already using `Vite.js`. We configure
and use `Vite.js` in `Nuxt` to speed up the development process. Another way we
use it is to add **Hot Module Replacement** support in the projects we exemplify
with simple html pages and add it to the project to facilitate development.
